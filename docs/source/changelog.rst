  - MAJOR version change when major backend or text modifications are made
    (for example: new topic).
  - MINOR version change when content or functionality is added or updated (for
    example: new videos, new activities, large number of text (typo/grammar) fixes).
  - HOTFIX version change when bug hotfixes are made (for example: fixing a typo).
  - A pre-release version is denoted by appending a hyphen and the alpha label
    followed by the pre-release version.
